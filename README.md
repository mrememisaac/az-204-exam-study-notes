Things I want to remember as I prepare to sit Exam AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure

## Serverless Compute
This is basically function as a service. 

Benefits include:
- infrastructure setup taken off you
- auto scaling
- cheaper than a VM (subject to duration/frequency of use) 
- pay for what you use
- awesome for stateless logic
- invoked by events
- resuable

Cons:
- 10 mins max execution time (can be as low as 2.5 minutes)
- costly for continous execution scenarios
- 

AZ Serverless compute options:
- AZ Functions
- AZ Logic Apps
